# Compression using AI

Let's build compressor that compete the winrar or zip compression !

In the **32x32x3** directory is an example of compressor for images 32x32x3 trained on the [CIFAR100](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/cifar100)


dataset. In the **High-resolution** directory, I tried to compress as much as possible images in high resolution using the [div2K](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/DIV2K/) database to train the models.
